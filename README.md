## Personal Portfolio 2.0

**UPDATE:**

# Features

- Responsive layout, works well on both Mobile and Desktop
- Dark mode support. Click buttons to toggle dark mode and light mode.
- Clear React components and tailwind styling.
- Exact sections that a developer needs to showcase their skills.
- Clear call to actions.

# Pages

I've kept the pages as simple as possible. Only the required sections are included with minimal content.

# Deployment

Deployment can be done in 3 easy steps.

- Login to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or signup for an account if you don't have one.
